		        <p>This is a visualization that reaches over a wide variety of common wine, quantified them based on their price and quality (quality is decided professional wine tasters). The purpose of the project is to acculumulate information about many popular wine into one accessible website. The website will make it very easy for readers to come in and find a cheap and tasty wine while learning something about that wine. 
		        <br>	
		        Since wine is very popular among all ethicities and all age groups, this will appeal to a lot of people who wants to try wine but just don't know what to get, also great for people who are trying to explore new options. This website will not be a one time use website, users who are satisfied with the wine they found will definitely return. </p>

		            <h2>Idea</h2>
		            <p> Have a Y and X scale. On the X Scale, we have the taste rating done by expert, on the Y scale, we have the price range. Each "point" will be represented by a wine bottle. Hovering over the bottle will display other information like name, flavor, place of origin. Other features include searching by wine type(Rose, Moscato, Chardonnay), and searching by price</p>

		          <div class="col-md-4">

		            <h2>Relevant Visualization</h2>
		            Our site will mostly resemble this visualization. Price and points on each axis. The price filter is also a very good feature.

		            </a>
		            <br>
		            I really like the way they used picture to describe the taste of the wine. The price and rating filter and search bar very useful.
